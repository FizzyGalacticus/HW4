Software Construction Assignment #4 - Learning PostScript.

Using PostScript online interpreter found here: http://www.feiri.de/pcan/

1. Modify the [square drawing program](http://www.tailrecursive.org/postscript/examples/box1.html) so that one side of the square is left open (that is, without a visible stroke).
2. Modify the program that (draws a line at different rotations)[http://www.tailrecursive.org/postscript/examples/rotate.html] so that the line being drawn gets longer as the rotation progresses.
3. Modify the program that (draws a box using translation)[http://www.tailrecursive.org/postscript/examples/translate.html] so that it draws a 3 by 3 array of boxes.
4. Modify the program that (draws two boxes and two lines)[http://www.tailrecursive.org/postscript/examples/shadewidth.html] so that the boxes appear to have roughly the same size. Then modify it again so that the last box is drawn several times at different rotations.
5. Write a program of your own that draws something moderately complex, and uses at least one circle or circular arc. To draw a circle or arc, you will need to use the arc command, described in the tutorial here.
6. Combine these six programs into one program that prints six pages. Turn in (here on Blackboard) the .ps file.
